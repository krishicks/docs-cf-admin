_This page assumes you are using [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) v6.4 or higher._

<%= vars.product_full %> blocks all outbound network connections from
application containers by default. This block-by-default behavior can be
overridden by <%= vars.product_full %> administrators with Application Security
Groups (ASGs).

ASGs are a collection of egress rules that specify one or more individual
protocols, ports, and destinations to allow network access to.

<%= vars.product_full %> has two default sets of ASGs, `default-staging` and
`default-running`. All application containers in <%= vars.product_full %> use a
base policy from one of these.

The `default-staging` ASG set applies to application containers that are in the
staging application lifecycle phase. This includes both the buildpack staging
and Docker staging process.

The `default-running` ASG set applies to application containers that are
started and running applications.

In addition to the `default-staging` and `default-running` ASG sets, <%= vars.product_full %>
administrators may configure additional ASGs which may be bound to <%= vars.product_full %>
[spaces](../concepts/roles.html#spaces). ASGs bound to spaces add network
access only to the application containers within that space.

When an application container is created the egress rules for that application
container is the union of:

* All ASGs in either the `default-staging` or `default-running` set
* All ASGs bound to the space of the application

## <a id='viewing'></a>Viewing Application Security Groups ##

Run the following commands to view information about existing application security groups:

|Command                             |Output
|---                                 |---
|`cf security-groups`                |Display all security groups in an org
|`cf staging-security-groups`        |Display all security groups in the `default-staging` set
|`cf running-security-groups`        |Display all security groups in the `default-running` set
|`cf security-group SG-NAME`         |Display the content of the specified security group

## <a id='creating-groups'></a>Creating Application Security Groups ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: After creating an ASG you will need to bind it for it to take effect. See <a href="#binding-groups">Binding Application Security Groups</a>.</p>

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: For examples of typical ASGs, see <a href="#typical-groups">Typical Application Security Groups</a>.</p>

ASG rules are specified as a JSON array of ASG objects. An ASG object has the following attributes:


|Attribute      |Description
|---            |---
|`protocol`     |`tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp`. For `icmp` you must also provide `code` and `type`
|`destination`  |An IP address or CIDR block that can receive traffic
|`ports`        |A single port or range of ports that can receive traffic, e.g. `"443"`, `"80,8080"`, `"8080-8081"`
|`code`         |ICMP code, required when setting `protocol` to `icmp`
|`type`         |ICMP type, required when setting `protocol` to `icmp`
|`log`          |Set to `true` to enable logging. For more information on how to configure system logs to be sent to a syslog drain see <a href="../devguide/services/log-management.html">Using Log Management Services</a>

To create an ASG:

1. Create a rules file as a JSON-formatted single array containing objects that
describe the rules. Refer to the example below, which allows ICMP traffic of
code 1 and type 0 to all destinations, and TCP traffic to 10.0.11.0/24 on ports
80-443:

    ```
    [
      {
        "protocol": "icmp",
        "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
        "type": 0,
        "code": 1
      },
      {
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "destination": "10.0.11.0/24",
        "ports": "80-443",
        "log": true
      }
    ]
    ```

1. Run the following `cf` CLI command, replacing `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group and `PATH-TO-RULES-FILE` with the absolute or relative path to a rules file.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-security-group SECURITY-GROUP PATH-TO-RULES-FILE
</pre>

## <a id='updating-groups'></a>Updating Application Security Groups ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: After updating an ASG you will need to restart any started applications it applies to for the changes to take effect.</p>

To update an existing ASG, run the following command, replacing `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group and `PATH-TO-RULES-FILE` with the absolute or relative path to a rules file.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-security-group SECURITY-GROUP PATH-TO-RULES-FILE
</pre>

## <a id='binding-groups'></a>Binding Application Security Groups ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: To apply ASGs after binding them to started applications, restart all started applications that ASG applies to.</p>

Before an ASG will be applied to application containers it needs to be bound to a default set or a space.

To bind an ASG to the `default-staging` set:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-staging-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To bind an ASG to the `default-running` set:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-running-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To bind an ASG to a specific space:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG SPACE
</pre>

## <a id='unbinding-groups'></a>Unbinding Application Security Groups ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Unbinding an ASG will not affect containers that are already started. After unbinding an ASG you will need to restart any applications it applies to for the changes to take effect.</p>

To unbind an ASG from the `default-staging` set:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-staging-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To unbind an ASG from the `default-running` set:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-running-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To unbind an ASG from a specific space:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG SPACE
</pre>

## <a id='deleting-groups'></a>Deleting Application Security Groups ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: You must <a href="#unbinding-groups">unbind</a> the ASG prior to deleting it.</p>

To delete an ASG:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

## <a id='typical-groups'></a>Typical Application Security Groups ##

Below are examples of typical ASGs. Your ASGs should be configured in
accordance with your organization’s network access policy for untrusted
applications.

* `dns`
* `public_networks`
* `private_networks_load_balancers`
* `private_networks_proxies`
* `private_networks_docker_registries`
* `private_networks_pcf_tiles`
* `private_networks_other_endpoints`

### <a id='dns-example'></a>DNS ###

In order to resolve hostnames to IPs, applications require DNS server
connectivity, which typically use port 53. Administrators should create or
update a `dns` ASG with appropriate rules. Administrators may further restrict
the DNS servers to specific IPs or ranges of IPs. Ensure DNS server IPs for the
`dns` ASG include IPs from the list supplied in the Ops Manager Director
‘Create Networks’ section for the network assigned to the <%= vars.product_full %> tile.

Example `dns` ASG:

```
[
  {"protocol":"tcp","destination":"0.0.0.0/0","ports":"53"},
  {"protocol":"udp","destination":"0.0.0.0/0","ports":"53"}
]
```

### <a id='public-networks-example'></a>Public Networks ###

Public network connectivity is often required by applications to retrieve application dependencies or to integrate with services available on public networks. Example application dependences include public Maven Repositories, NPM, RubyGems, Docker Registries and other public network locations. If access to public networks should be allowed for some applications, create or update a public_networks ASG with appropriate rules.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: It is strongly recommended to exclude IaaS metadata endpoints, such as 169.254.169.254, because the metadata server could expose sensitive environment information to untrusted applications. The `public_networks` example below accounts for this recommendation.

Example `public_networks` ASG:

```
[
  {"destination": "0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255","protocol": "all"},
  {"destination": "11.0.0.0-169.253.255.255","protocol": "all"},
  {"destination": "169.255.0.0-172.15.255.255","protocol": "all"},
  {"destination": "172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255","protocol": "all"},
  {"destination": "192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255","protocol": "all"}
]
```

### <a id='private-networks-example'></a>Private Networks ###

Network connections that are commonly allowable in private networks include
endpoints such as Proxy Servers, Docker Registries, Load Balancers, Databases,
Messaging Servers, Directory Servers, File Servers, etc. Configure appropriate
private network ASGs as appropriate. It may be helpful to use a naming
convention with private_networks as part of the ASG name.

Example `private_networks` ASG:

```
[
  {"protocol":"tcp","destination":"10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255","ports":"443"},
  {"protocol":"tcp","destination":"172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255","ports":"443"},
  {"protocol":"tcp","destination":"192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255","ports":"443"}
]
```
